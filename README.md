### 1. Project Overview

#### 1.1 Data
The file `autoscout24.csv` contains information from AutoScout24 about sold cars. The data needs to be analyzed and visualized.

#### 1.2 Analysis
- **How many cars were sold? Over what period?**
- **What brands are included in the dataset?**
- **Are there correlations between the (numerical) features? (Scatterplots)**
- **Are there any trends or changes over the years?**
- **Think of additional interesting questions to explore using the given data.**

#### 1.3 Machine Learning
- **Which 5 manufacturers had the most cars sold?**
- Focus on the samples of these 5 manufacturers only.
  - **What was the average price of a car from manufacturer X?**
  - **Train a model of your choice (e.g., Linear Regression) to predict the sale price of a car based on selected features.**
  - **What category of Machine Learning does this problem fall under?**
  - **How is the model's performance evaluated? What is the error metric?**
  - **Experiment with other models as well.**

#### 1.4 Dashboard
- **Create a dashboard (using Streamlit, Tableau, etc.) to visually present the results.**
- **This dashboard should help viewers intuitively understand the insights gained from the data.**
- **Ensure the plots are well-designed with proper axis labels and other details.**
